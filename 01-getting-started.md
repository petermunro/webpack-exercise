## Getting Started with Webpack

### Install Webpack

1. First, install Webpack:

        npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev


### Getting Started

1. The directory `01-simple` contains a simple app which modifies
   an element and prints a message to the console. Change into
	 this directory and use Webpack to bundle up the assets
	 (there's only one right now) into a `main.js`:
   
        npx webpack ./src/js/app.js -o ./dist
	
	 > `npx` comes with Node 8.2/npm 5.2.0 or higher. You can also run `./node_modules/.bin/webpack ...`.

	 > webpack gives a scary looking message "WARNING in configuration" -
	   but of course we haven't configured it yet! We'll do that shortly.

2. Check that webpack has created a `dist` directory containing a `main.js`.

3. Copy the `index.html` over to the `dist` directory, and edit it
	 to load the `main.js` from the `dist` directory, instead of `js/app.js`.

4. Test that it works in a browser. You should see the message "Welcome
	 to Webpack!" generated by the JS file.

5. View the `dist/main.js` file. What does it contain?
